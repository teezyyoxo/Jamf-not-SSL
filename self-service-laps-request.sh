# SELF SERVICE LAPS REQUEST (SSLR?)
# This script masquerades as a Self Service item on macOS.
# When this item's "Request" button is clicked, the script leverages the Jamf Pro API to
# retrieve the current machine's LAPS password, and send it to a specified channel in
# Microsoft Teams for the ITS personnel to have ready prior to connecting remotely.

# !!!!!!! IMPORTANT !!!!!!!
# You MUST:
# a. Create an .env file (saved in the same directory as the script, or get the exact path to it)
# b. Ensure the ENV_FILE variable is defined correctly.

# Version 3.0a
# - FOR TESTING ONLY: Added an osascript line to produce a Push Notification to the user indicating that the password was copied to the clipboard.
# - MAY REMOVE IN FUTURE VERSION(S).
# Version 3.0
# - Code cleanup/condensing
# - Added automatic copying of the retrieved password to clipboard
# Version 2.0
# - No more plaintext credentials. Switched to using a private .env file.
# Version 1.0
# - Initial release.
