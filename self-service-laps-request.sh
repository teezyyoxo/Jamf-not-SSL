# SELF SERVICE LAPS REQUEST (SSLR?) - BASIC
# This script masquerades as a Self Service item on macOS.
# When this item's "Request" button is clicked, the script leverages the Jamf Pro API to
# retrieve the current machine's LAPS password, and send it to a specified channel in
# Microsoft Teams for the ITS personnel to have ready prior to connecting remotely.

# !!!!!!! IMPORTANT !!!!!!!
# You MUST:
# a. Create an .env file (saved in the same directory as the script, or get the exact path to it)
# b. Ensure the ENV_FILE variable is defined correctly.


# Version 4.9.7a
# - Fixed: Added missing `get_jamf_token` function to properly retrieve the Jamf Pro API token.
# - Improved: Implemented debug logging for the API token retrieval process to aid in troubleshooting.
# - Error Handling: Enhanced error checking to ensure the script exits if the API token cannot be retrieved.
# Version 4.9.6a
# - Added missing function declaration for get_jamf_token. Derp.
# Version 4.9.5a
# - Now uses the correct API endpoint (/v2/local-admin-password/{client-management-id}/account/{username}/password)
# Version 4.9.4a
# - Fixed get_jamf_token function again to ensure the token value is non-empty.
# - Changed ".access_token" to "".token".
# Version 4.9.3a
# - Fixed COMPUTER_ID variable logic (sed is actually insane).
# Version 4.9.2a
# - Script now requires root because it includes "jamf recon" and checks for this immediately upon execution.
# Version 4.9.1a
# - Added RECON_OUTPUT variable to capture the (truncated) Jamf Pro Computer ID from "sudo jamf recon".
# Version 4.9a
# - Switched from using serial number to grabbing the Jamf Pro Computer ID from "jamf recon" and using that with the API.
# Version 4.8a
# - Split script into two: one that uses API credentials, and one that doesn't. For my sanity.
# Version 4.7a
# - You guessed it - more debugging.
# Version 4.6a
# - Removed extraneous shebang.
# Version 4.5a
# - Variable name fix.
# Version 4.4a
# - More debugging.
# Version 4.3a
# - Added more debugging.
# Version 4.2a
# - Fixed mistyped variables in get_jamf_token function.
# Version 4.1a
# - Prefixed CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET with "API_" (i.e., API_CLIENT_ID).
# Version 4.0a
# - Fashionably late: switched to OAuth2.
# Version 3.0a
# - FOR TESTING ONLY: Added an osascript line to produce a Push Notification to the user indicating that the password was copied to the clipboard.
# - MAY REMOVE IN FUTURE VERSION(S).
# Version 3.0
# - Code cleanup/condensing
# - Added automatic copying of the retrieved password to clipboard
# Version 2.0
# - No more plaintext credentials. Switched to using a private .env file.
# Version 1.0
# - Initial release.
